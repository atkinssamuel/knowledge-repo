Recommendation:

> A nonparametric clustering technique incorporating the concept of similarity based on the sharing of near neighbors is presented. In addition to being an essentially paraliel approach, the computational elegance of the method is such that the scheme is applicable to a wide class of practical problems involving large sample size and high dimensionality. No attempt is made to show how a priori problem knowledge can be introduced into the procedure.
