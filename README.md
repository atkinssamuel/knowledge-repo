# Knowledge Repo
This repository tracks the papers that I have read, my notes on these papers, and their major contributions. Consult ```template.md``` for information on how to add new papers to the repository.

For sections with more than 2 papers, add an ```index.md``` file using the ```index.md``` template in the base directory.
