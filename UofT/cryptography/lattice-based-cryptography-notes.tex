\paragraph{One-Way Functions}
One-way functions are easy to compute in the "forward" direction, but difficult to compute in the reverse. Mathematically, given x, it is easy to compute f(x), but very difficult to compute the value of x given f(x). 


\paragraph{Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption}
Symmetric encryption: a single, shared key
We encrypt and decrypt with the same shared key.

Asymmetric encryption (public key cryptography): use one key for encryption and one key for decryption
The key used for encryption is called the public key and the key used for decryption is called the private key. Everyone has access to the public key but nobody but you should have access to the private key. You can't derive the private key given the public key.


\paragraph{Encryption Schemes}
There are various ways in which the keys used during symmetric and asymmetric encryption are generated. These "ways" are called encryption schemes.
